<!-- // INSTRUCTIONS
Create a small Vue application that compares llamas to alpacas. This can be as simple or as complex as you wish as far
as content goes. You may format it anyway you'd like (but remember, this is a 10pt assignment, so don't spend too much
time on formatting). The finished page should:

Link to the Vue CDN
Use v-cloak to hide the templating before Vue loads
Should have links to the wikipedia pages for both llamas and alpacas. These links should use attribute binding.
Should have examples of both style binding and class binding.

*** QUESTIONS:
VUE- does it always have brackets? Does it live in both JS & CSS? 
what is a mustache? the curly brackets? curly brackets when theres 
also my scripts for style... are those correct? video vs older html copy- do I need both?
Notes on Attribute Binding:
uses a href= normally in HTML, but w/ VUE, can't do that. 
must use <a v-bind:href=" ">My Link</a>
