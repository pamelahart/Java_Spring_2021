<!-- 7.A | ✳️ Assignment 7: Show and Tell Collection
11 unread reply.11 reply.
Estimated time: up to 4 hours

INSTRUCTIONS
Create a list displaying a collection of items with conditional formatting.

Select an item that you collect or would like to collect (baseball cards, European high-performance cars, Power Ranger
figures; it can literally be anything). Create an POJO (plain old javascript object) that represents one unit of that
collection. For example, if I was selecting retro video game consoles, my first POJO would look like this:

For this assignment, your collection object should have 3 to 5 properties. Create an array of exactly 5 of these objects
and include this array as one of the properties in your Vue data object.



var myVue = new Vue({
el: "#app",
data: {
consoles: [
{...}, // this would be the NES object
{...}, // and this might be the N64
// and so on
]
}
});

Use the array you just made to create a list of your collection using v-for to render each item as one row of you list.
You are not constrained to using a table for you html; you may use div or some combination of un-ordered lists and divs.
Each row should display at least 4 properties from you collection objects. The values of each property will make up the
columns in your list.

You should make an appropriate row with column headings as well as an appropriate page heading for the collection in
general.

Additional requirements:

Use conditional class bindings to alter one set of rows from the rest. This could be as simple as make every other row
darker or displaying a special styling some subset in your collection. (For example, Nintendo consoles may have a
Nintendo logo applied via CSS, or the most valuable console may use a CSS class to impose two dollar signs to its row).
If you do something other than odd and even rows, please indicate with an explanation (perhaps in the form of a legend)
somewhere on your page.

Future consideration:

This project will serve as the base for next week’s assignment where we learn to add new items to and delete items from
your collection. Keep that in mind as you choose your content. I would recommend something you really are interested in.
